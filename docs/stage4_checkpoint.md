# Stage 4 Checkpoint — Leading Indicator Validation

**Date:** 2026-04-30
**Status:** COMPLETED

> ** Sign Convention Correction Notice (added 2026-05-03)**
>
> Stage 7 Track A2 (Sign Convention Validation) detected a sign convention error in Stage 4's DTW + cross-correlation implementations. Both methods use `correlate(kr, gl)` and `path[:,0] - path[:,1]` formulations that produce **positive values when Global leads Korea**, but Stage 4 labeled positive values as "Korea leads" — a verbal-mathematical inversion.
>
> **Magnitude robust** — leakage-free replication reproduces Stage 4 magnitudes within ±2w (DTW median 9.00w vs Stage 4 +10.4w; CC magnitude 10 vs Stage 4 +9w).
>
> **Direction inverted** — confirmed via three independent quantitative signatures:
> 1. Synthetic Korea-leads-by-5w probe → Stage 4 code returns CC −5, DTW −4.57 (sign inverted, magnitude correct)
> 2. Mediation re-run with corrected direction → inconsistent signature dissipation (% indirect 120% → 11%) + BCa CI 47% narrowing
> 3. Track A3 degradation magnitude reduction 1/4–1/5 (Korea→Global pre-correction Prophet/SARIMAX +41~59% vs Global→Korea post-correction +9~11%)
>
> Cumulative evidence in stage7_checkpoint.md §12.4.4.
>
> **DB retrofit applied** — `mart.korea_global_lag` table received migration `011_korea_global_lag_sign_correction.sql` on 2026-05-03, flipping `mean_lag_weeks`, `median_lag_weeks`, `cc_best_lag_weeks` signs and swapping `lag_direction` labels for all 12 rows. Post-commit distribution: Global leads = 10, Korea leads = 2 (NB rows uniformly 'Global leads' across all deseason_method).
>
> **Stage 4 narrative body below is preserved as-is** for trace value (advisor decision 4: trace preservation pattern). When interpreting lag values and direction labels in this document, apply sign correction lens:
> - "Korea leads by +Xw" → "Global leads by Xw"
> - "Global leads by Xw" (already negative-magnitude) → "Korea leads by Xw"
> - DP9 (B2 Key Finding line 165): "NB Korea → Global Structural Lead +10.4w" → "**NB Global → Korea Structural Lead ~10.4w**"
> - DP21 / DP22 narrative downstream: see stage7_checkpoint.md Cascade Corrections section
>
> **Cross-references:** stage7_checkpoint.md (Track A2 + DP24 detection + §12.4 quantitative validation), exploratory_findings.md (DP24 sign inversion, DP9 sign-corrected, DP22 deprecated → DP24 successor), v3 §4.5 Hypothesis Evolution sub-section.
>
> The original Stage 4 analysis methodology (DTW + CC dual-method approach, three-dimensional separation logic with subsequent cointegration and mediation analyses, seasonal artifact identification) remains valid in structure. Only the directional labeling required correction; the shape similarity finding, magnitude estimates, and three-dimensional separation conclusions are robust.

**Tracks:** A (Granger Search ↔ CSI) + B (DTW Korea-Global Lead-Lag)

## Track A: Search ↔ CSI Granger Causality

### A1: Data Extraction

| Source | Rows | Period |
|---|---|---|
| mart.brand_kpi_weekly (search_index) | 1,392 | 2022-12-25 ~ 2026-04-19 |
| mart.seasonal_components (residual) | 2,784 | 2022-12-25 ~ 2026-04-19 |
| staging.search_weekly (shopping) | 696 | Korea only |
| raw.ecos_raw (CSI) | 52 | 2022-01 ~ 2026-04 |

### A2: Time Alignment

- Search MSTL residual: weekly → monthly mean (week_start determines month)
- CSI: monthly, no transformation needed at this step
- Common period: 2022-12 ~ 2026-04 (41 months per brand×region)
- Sufficient for Granger with maxlag=4 (df=37)

### A3: Stationarity Tests (ADF + KPSS)

| Series | ADF stat | ADF p | KPSS p | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CSI_level | -2.7695 | 0.0628 | 0.0541 | Difference-stationary |
| CSI_diff1 | -4.4781 | 0.0002 | 0.1000 | Stationary |
| adidas_global_residual | -2.0377 | 0.2703 | 0.1000 | Difference-stationary |
| adidas_korea_residual | -4.0410 | 0.0012 | 0.1000 | Stationary |
| new_balance_global_residual | -3.6302 | 0.0052 | 0.1000 | Stationary |
| new_balance_korea_residual | -4.4300 | 0.0003 | 0.1000 | Stationary |
| nike_global_residual | -2.8151 | 0.0562 | 0.1000 | Difference-stationary |
| nike_korea_residual | -4.3039 | 0.0004 | 0.1000 | Stationary |
| puma_global_residual | -2.9634 | 0.0385 | 0.1000 | Stationary |
| puma_korea_residual | -4.5113 | 0.0002 | 0.1000 | Stationary |

**Preprocessing decision:**
- Search: MSTL residual (innovation component). 6/8 stationary at level.
- CSI: 1st differencing applied (level ADF p=0.0628, diff1 p=0.0002).
- Asymmetric preprocessing rationale documented in methodology.md §7.2.

**Non-stationary residuals:** adidas/global (p=0.2703), nike/global (p=0.0562). Robustness check conducted (see A4-R below).

### A4: Bidirectional Granger Causality

**Design:** 8 brand×region pairs × 2 directions × maxlag=4 = 64 tests.

**P-value Matrix — Search → CSI:**

| Brand | Region | Lag 1 | Lag 2 | Lag 3 | Lag 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adidas | global | 0.6895 | 0.0632 | 0.1664 | **0.0443** |
| adidas | korea | 0.7462 | 0.0889 | **0.0374** | **0.0253** |
| new_balance | global | 0.3174 | 0.7971 | 0.7146 | 0.7926 |
| new_balance | korea | 0.3508 | 0.5855 | 0.1915 | 0.1564 |
| nike | global | 0.3398 | 0.6250 | 0.4013 | 0.5722 |
| nike | korea | 0.9594 | 0.3559 | **0.0171** | **0.0279** |
| puma | global | 0.3491 | 0.7295 | 0.8014 | 0.8837 |
| puma | korea | 0.3222 | 0.0725 | 0.0664 | 0.1260 |

**P-value Matrix — CSI → Search:**

| Brand | Region | Lag 1 | Lag 2 | Lag 3 | Lag 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adidas | global | 0.4779 | 0.5198 | 0.7199 | 0.8327 |
| adidas | korea | 0.6308 | 0.0553 | **0.0409** | 0.0517 |
| new_balance | global | 0.4173 | **0.0321** | **0.0016** | **0.0079** |
| new_balance | korea | 0.5801 | 0.0709 | **0.0229** | **0.0161** |
| nike | global | 0.7173 | 0.3948 | 0.0812 | 0.2174 |
| nike | korea | 0.8367 | 0.3312 | 0.2342 | 0.3833 |
| puma | global | 0.9105 | 0.0952 | **0.0004** | **0.0023** |
| puma | korea | 0.4657 | 0.0558 | 0.1016 | 0.2338 |

### A4 Result: 4-Pattern Classification

| Brand | Global | Korea |
|---|---|---|
| adidas | Search→CSI (robust) | Feedback loop |
| new_balance | CSI→Search | CSI→Search |
| nike | Independent | Search→CSI |
| puma | CSI→Search | Independent |

**Original hypothesis: "Search → CSI" — supported in 2/8 pairs (25%).**

This is an honest negative result on the primary hypothesis. However, the 4-pattern classification itself is the discovery: brands exhibit structurally different relationships with macro consumer sentiment, and the pattern is consistent with brand positioning and market power.

**Cross-brand interpretation:**

- adidas/nike: Search leads or is independent of CSI — brand inertia sustains search demand regardless of macro conditions.
- NB: CSI→Search in both regions — search demand follows macro sentiment improvement. Two complementary interpretations: (1) reactive demand consistent with "demand-conversion gap" (Stage 3), (2) elasticity of a newer/smaller brand whose search is discretionary exploration ("browse when confident"). Both converge on the same actionable implication: **NB requires active search demand defense during macro downturns.**
- This asymmetry connects to Stage 3's cross-cutting findings: NB Korea's search over-index (+34.94%) combined with lowest sentiment (+0.289) and CSI-reactive search structure paints a brand that captures attention but cannot sustain it independently of macro conditions.

### A4-R: Robustness Check (Non-stationary Residuals)

adidas/global and nike/global residuals were 1st-differenced and Granger re-run.

**adidas/global (original: Search→CSI at lag 4, p=0.0443):**
- Differenced residual ADF: p=0.0000 (stationary)
- Search(d1)→CSI(d1): lag 3 p=0.0409, lag 4 p=0.0140 — **significance survives**
- CSI(d1)→Search(d1): all lags non-significant
- Verdict: **robust**

**nike/global (original: Independent):**
- Differenced residual ADF: p=0.0000 (stationary)
- Both directions all lags non-significant
- Verdict: **Independent confirmed**

### A5: VAR + IRF

| Brand | Region | VAR Order | AIC | Cointegration p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| adidas | global | VAR(2) | 2.36 | — |
| adidas | korea | VAR(3) | 3.75 | 0.0135 |
| new_balance | global | VAR(3) | 1.95 | 0.0190 |
| new_balance | korea | VAR(4) | 2.45 | 0.0008 |
| nike | global | VAR(3) | 4.76 | — |
| nike | korea | VAR(3) | 4.70 | 0.0070 |
| puma | global | VAR(3) | 0.47 | — |
| puma | korea | VAR(2) | 1.38 | 0.0033 |

**Cointegration:** 5/8 pairs show Engle-Granger cointegration (p<0.05). NB/korea strongest (p=0.0008) — long-run equilibrium between NB search and consumer sentiment, reinforcing the "demand-conversion gap" narrative. VECM estimation deferred to Stage 7.

IRF plots saved to `figures/var/irf/` (8 plots).

### A6: Shopping Search Sub-analysis

All 4 brands × korea-only: non-significant in both directions.

**Caveat:** Google Trends shopping category does not represent Korean purchase-intent search behavior — Naver Shopping is the dominant channel. Null result reflects channel coverage, not absence of purchase-intent ↔ CSI linkage.

## Track B: DTW Korea-Global Lead-Lag

### B1: Data Extraction

4 brands × 2 regions × 348 weeks from mart.brand_kpi_weekly + mart.seasonal_components.

### B2: 3-Way DTW Comparison

| Brand | Raw Lag | Trend Lag | Residual Lag | Raw Direction | Trend Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adidas | -14.0w | +17.3w | +12.8w | Global leads | Korea leads |
| new_balance | +48.0w | **+10.4w** | +42.2w | Korea leads | Korea leads |
| nike | -70.4w | +99.1w | +26.8w | Global leads | Korea leads |
| puma | +57.0w | +26.2w | +25.1w | Korea leads | Korea leads |

**Seasonal artifact confirmation:**

Raw DTW lags cluster near 52w (half-year/annual range) — consistent with Stage 3's Korea=FW dominant vs Global=SS dominant seasonal asymmetry. DTW aligns the FW peak of one region to the SS peak of the other, producing ~52w phantom lags. This is a methodological red flag, not a real lead-lag finding.

Trend DTW removes seasonal contamination:
- **NB: 48w → 10.4w** — seasonal artifact stripped, real structural lead = ~2.5 months. CC lag confirms at 9w.
- **adidas: -14w → 17.3w** — direction reverses, magnitude stable. Most synchronized global brand.
- **puma: 57w → 26.2w** — partial reduction, still substantial.
- **nike: -70w → 99w** — unstable, norm DTW 0.0904 (highest). Korea/Global trend shapes are too dissimilar for meaningful DTW alignment.

**Residual DTW caveat:** MSTL residuals approximate white noise; DTW on noise can produce arbitrary large lags. Residual DTW results are reported but not used as primary evidence.

### B2 Key Finding: NB Korea → Global Structural Lead

NB trend DTW +10.4w with CC confirmation +9w is the cleanest result across all brands. **NB Korea's structural growth trajectory precedes Global by approximately 10 weeks (~2.5 months).**

**Stage 0 H1 correction chain:** cross-correlation -167w (artifact) → raw DTW +48w (seasonal contamination) → trend DTW +10.4w (deseasonalized, confirmed by CC).

## Quantified Insights (Stage 4)

1. **4-pattern Granger classification:** Search→CSI, CSI→Search, Feedback, Independent across 8 brand×region pairs
2. **NB CSI→Search in both regions:** macro-reactive demand structure, consistent with premium/newer brand positioning
3. **Primary hypothesis 25% support:** Search→CSI in 2/8 pairs — honest negative result, pattern diversity is the finding
4. **adidas/global robust after differencing:** lag 4 p=0.0140, non-spurious
5. **Cointegration 5/8:** NB/korea strongest (p=0.0008), long-run search-sentiment equilibrium
6. **Shopping search null:** Google Shopping channel coverage limitation in Korea
7. **NB Korea→Global trend lead +10.4w:** structural growth trajectory precedes Global by ~2.5 months
8. **Raw DTW seasonal artifact confirmed:** 48-70w lags collapse to 10-26w after deseasonalizing
9. **Stage 0 H1 fully corrected:** -167w → +48w → +10.4w refinement chain

## Track A + B Combined Narrative

NB Korea is structurally positioned as a **macro-sentiment-reactive brand with regional lead**:

- **Macro sensitivity (Track A):** NB search demand follows CSI, not the other way around. Unlike adidas/Nike with brand inertia, NB's search is elastic to consumer confidence.
- **Regional lead (Track B):** NB Korea's structural growth trend precedes Global by ~10 weeks. Korea acts as an early signal for NB's global trajectory.
- **Combined implication:** A potential chain exists — CSI → NB Korea Search → NB Global Search — where macro consumer sentiment drives NB Korea demand, which in turn leads NB Global demand by ~10 weeks. Quantitative verification of this 3-stage chain is deferred to Stage 7 (Korea-Global Bridge).

This finding transforms the "demand-conversion gap" from a weakness into a dual narrative:
- **Weakness:** NB cannot independently sustain search demand during macro downturns
- **Strength:** NB Korea serves as a leading indicator for NB Global, giving BDC a ~10-week advance signal for global demand shifts
